# Purple Attack

Welcome to the Purple Attack repository! This is a 1v1 multiplayer expirience programmed by me for a school project.
The goal of the game is to hack your friend and steal there password. First one to do that wins.

This game was created for a school project, and is not finished. There is still a lot of work to be done here.

All projects were made in Eclipse, and can be imported as a java project.

The workspace was created in Eclipse 2019-03 (4.11.0)

The project was made in Eclipse, and therefore is in a workspace to make things easier for me.
